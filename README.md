Anyone can help translate DotStrike into any language.

If you have experience with GitHub, then you know what to do. ðŸ˜‰

If you do not know what GitHub is or do not know how to use it, then this short guide is for you. 

## Getting Started

You can go the easy way or the hard way.

### Easy way

1. You need to create a fork of the project. You can do this by clicking on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.
2. Select the account under which you will fork.
3. You need to wait a bit while a copy of the project is being created.
4. After a successful fork, you can make changes to the project.

### Hard way

To do this, you need to be able to use the git tool. I will not describe this method, it is better to use the easy way. ðŸ™‚

#### Editing an existing localization file

If you are editing an existing localization file, open it and click on the pencil icon. If you hover over it, the prompt "Edit this file" will appear.
Make edits. Go down to the very bottom of the page and click on the "Commit changes" button.

## If you are ready to submit the changes to us

1. Go to the "Pull requests" page at github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/DotStrike-translation/pulls. You can access this page by clicking on the "Pull requests" tab in your copy of the project. 
2. Click on the "New pull request" button. 
3. It remains only to click on the "Create pull request" button and we will receive your changes.

If you have any questions, you can find answers on the Internet.
